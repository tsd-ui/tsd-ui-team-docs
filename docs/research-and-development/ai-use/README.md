# AI Use

Some suggestions for how you might incorporate AI use in your everyday workflows:

- Upskilling, generating tailored plans and project ideas for learning a new skill
- Generating tests and test suites
- Understanding a new (or very old) code base
- Helping debug issues and understand tradeoffs of different fixes
- Finding existing issues in a code base, like bugs or performance issues
- Finding duplicate or unnecessary dependencies, dead code, without incorporating additional tooling
- Enhancing PR reviews
- Breaking down complex work into smaller, manageable parts (i.e. assistance writing user stories or use cases)
- Setting up CI/CD workflows
- Rewriting or polishing documentation

Please do not forget to review the [company policy on AI Use](https://source.redhat.com/departments/legal/products_privacy_and_innovation/legal_wiki/policy_on_the_use_of_ai_technology) and the list of [approved tools and use cases](https://source.redhat.com/projects_and_programs/ai/ai_tools_and_use_cases).
