# 👋 Welcome

For **new team members**, this space will be helpful during your first days with the team, to better learn about who we are and how we work.

For **long-time team members**, this space will act as a reminder and allow you to find answers about admin and policies etc.

### How to use it?

This space is designed to be read linearly, so start from the top and work down from there! We recommend reading everything through in one sitting and then revisiting and re-reading if you need to.
