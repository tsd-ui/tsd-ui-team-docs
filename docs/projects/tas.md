RHTAS = Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer

RHTAS is a product of the upstream project [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/). The two UIs relevant to our team include the [RHTAS Console](https://github.com/securesign/rhtas-console-ui) (and it's [API](https://github.com/securesign/rhtas-console)) and the [Rekor Search UI](https://github.com/securesign/rekor-search-ui), which has now been integrated into the RHTAS Console.
