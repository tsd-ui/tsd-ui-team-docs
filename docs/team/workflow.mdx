# Team Workflows

Use this guide to familiarize yourself with our typical workflows and how we track our work.

## Jira statuses

The [Red Hat Standards for Jira](https://spaces.redhat.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=JiraAid&title=Red+Hat+Standards%3A+Issue+Types) includes a set of issue types and issue type schemes that are available to all projects in Red Hat Jira.

<span class="text--right" style={{float: "right"}}>
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SubTasks["Sub-Tasks"]
    StoriesTasks["Stories/Tasks"]
    Epic["Epic"]
    FeatureInitiative["Feature/Initiative"]
    Outcome["Outcome"]
    StrategicGoal["Strategic Goal"]

    %% Define the flow from bottom to top
    SubTasks --> StoriesTasks
    StoriesTasks --> Epic
    Epic --> FeatureInitiative
    FeatureInitiative --> Outcome
    Outcome --> StrategicGoal
```
</span>

The issue types form a hierarchy; there are 6 levels to it. Using the parent-child relationship, issues can be linked to one another, which allows us to connect work items to bigger efforts or goals. The top 3 levels are for strategic issues or strategic projects, and the bottom 3 levels are for execution (team) projects. Issue type schemes determine what issue types are available in a project–the scheme packages multiple issue types together.

### Strategic Goal

**Strategic Goals** are the highest level issue type in Jira. Within Product Engineering, they only exist in the `HATSTRAT` project, lending to them being colloquially called "Hat-strats."

### Outcome

**Outcomes** are where Product Management steps in. This level is where objectives should be focused on a measurable outcome.

### Feature/Initiative

A **Feature** is a large product/portfolio goal or focus area that has clear start and completion criteria. It may capture multiple deliverables broken down as epics spanning multiple teams and potentially multiple releases.

An **Initiative** is a capability or a well-defined set of functionality that delivers business value.

### Epic

An **Epic** is a big user story that needs to be broken down further. They group together bugs, stories, and tasks to show the progress of a larger effort. In agile development, epics usually represent a significant deliverable, such as a new capability or experience in the software your team develops. Epics are goal based and should be scoped to a single release.

### Stories/Tasks

A **Story** is the smallest unit of work that needs to be done and is end user facing.

A **Task** is a unit of work that needs to be accomplished, but isn't user facing.

### Sub-Tasks

A **Sub-Task** is a piece of work required to complete a Task. They're often used to break down tasks.

## Development workflow

This is a visual representation of what a typical development workflow looks for us and how the Jira status changes as we progress through it (color change indicates a status change in Jira):

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction TB

    [*] --> PlanSprint
    PlanSprint: Plan sprint/iteration (Backlog)

    PlanSprint --> DefineItem
    DefineItem: Define item & requirements (Backlog)

    DefineItem --> AssignItem
    AssignItem: Assign item (Backlog)

    AssignItem --> EstimateItem
    EstimateItem: Estimate item (In Progress)

    EstimateItem --> WorkOnItem
    WorkOnItem: Work on item (In Progress)

    WorkOnItem --> OpenPR
    OpenPR: Open PR (In Progress)

    OpenPR --> SharePR
    SharePR: Share PR for review (In Progress)

    SharePR --> ReviewPR
    ReviewPR: Review PR (In Progress)

    ReviewPR --> MergePR
    MergePR: Merge PR (In Review)

    MergePR --> GenerateSnapshot
    GenerateSnapshot: Snapshot is generated (In Review)

    GenerateSnapshot --> [*]

    %% Style definitions for status changes
    style PlanSprint fill:#ADD8E6,stroke:#000,stroke-width:1px
    style EstimateItem fill:#90EE90,stroke:#000,stroke-width:1px
    style MergePR fill:#FFA07A,stroke:#000,stroke-width:1px
```


:::info
Note that the JIRA status does not change when your PR is being reviewed, only once it has been merged and is ready for QE.
:::

Continuous throughout the workflow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UpstreamEngagement["Upstream engagement & monitoring for changes"]
    Synchronize["Synchronize upstream & midstream"]

    UpstreamEngagement --> Synchronize
    Synchronize --> UpstreamEngagement
```

Issues can arise (bugs, security) in our workflows that affect upstream. If that happens, be sure to share with the team as soon as possible.

## Quality workflows

### New build

Once a pull request is merged and the Jira status is updated, the QE process for testing a new build begins.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    direction TB

    Start([Start / End])
    RequestBuild["Request new build"]
    NewPR["New PR in Releases repo"]
    NotifyQE["Notify QE"]
    CreateJIRA["Create JIRA for verification"]

    %% Define a subgraph for Acceptance Criteria
    subgraph AcceptanceCriteriaGroup [Build acceptance criteria]
        SmallTest["Small test (structural test)"]
        PassAcceptance{"Build passed acceptance criteria?"}
    end

    NotifyQETest["Notify QE to test build"]
    RegressionTests["Regression tests"]
    ManualTests["Manual tests"]
    IssueVerification["Issue verification"]
    DocVerification["Doc verification"]
    ReleaseCriteria{"<a href="#release-criteria">Release Criteria</a> met?"}
    UpdateJIRA["Update JIRA"]
    ReleaseBuild["Release build"]
    End([End])

    %% Define the flow with direct connections
    Start --> NewPR
    NewPR --> NotifyQE
    NotifyQE --> CreateJIRA
    CreateJIRA --> SmallTest
    SmallTest --> PassAcceptance
    PassAcceptance -->|Yes| NotifyQETest
    PassAcceptance -->|No| ReopenBug["Create bug / Reopen issue"]
    ReopenBug --> RequestBuild
    NotifyQETest --> RegressionTests
    NotifyQETest --> ManualTests
    NotifyQETest --> IssueVerification
    NotifyQETest --> DocVerification
    RegressionTests --> ReleaseCriteria
    ManualTests --> ReleaseCriteria
    IssueVerification --> ReleaseCriteria
    DocVerification --> ReleaseCriteria
    ReleaseCriteria -->|Yes| UpdateJIRA
    ReleaseCriteria -->|No| ReopenBug
    UpdateJIRA --> ReleaseBuild
    ReleaseBuild --> End
```

#### Release Criteria

- **Bugs** - Blocker, Critical all resolved (<a href="https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12429670&jql=project%20in%20(%22Trusted%20Artifact%20Signer%22)%20and%20issuetype%20%3D%20Feature%20and%20fixVersion%20%3D%201.1.0%20and%20status%20%3D%20%22Release%20Pending%22%20order%20by%20priority" target="_blank">Release Pending</a>)
- **Customer Cases** - all resolved (Release Pending)
- **Regressions not Done** - all resolved
- **DOC Issues in Content Plan** - all resolved (Release Pending)

### Issue verification

<span style={{float: "right", margin: "0.8em"}}>
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IssueVerification["Issue verification"]
    Passed{"Passed?"}
    ReleasePending["Change status: Release pending"]
    Waiting["Change status: Waiting"]
    End([End])

    %% Define the flow
    IssueVerification --> Passed
    Passed -->|Passed| ReleasePending
    Passed -->|Failed| Waiting
    ReleasePending --> End
    Waiting --> End
```
</span>
- **Issue Outcome**: Ensure the implementation meets the initial request and addresses the issue fully. Functionality: Verify that the feature works as expected and hasn’t been broken by other changes.
- **Documentation**: Confirm that all necessary documentation is provided.
- **Test Coverage**: Check that appropriate tests have been added.
- **Release Notes**: Review the release notes for clarity and completeness.

[Here is an example](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SECURESIGN-1318) of a Jira verification issue.

<br/>

:::tip
It's important that the review is conducted by someone other than the person who resolved the issue. Ideally, the review should be performed by the original reporter if possible.

## Release workflows

The release workflow will differ based on the target (e.g. OpenShift, RHEL). For information about how to do a release, and to see an overview of the process, go [here](/technical-guides/release-coordination#process-overview).
